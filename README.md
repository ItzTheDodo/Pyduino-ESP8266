# Pyduino-ESP8266
This is a very simple python library that allows you to do the basics of Arduino C++ in python utilising the wifi ESP 8266 board, I originally made this for a drone project I was working on however I added an extra class for customising it to your needs.

I have added a setup folder with two files to help with any problems you may come across as of setting it up. This library is sutable for connecting with an arduino wirelessly and communicating with it over wifi.
To be able to send data you will need to know you esp's ip, which can be fetched over telnet, for hardcoding into your python script and entering it into the arduino code where prompted.
I'll leave some links for creating your own programs using the ESP8266 and the featured GPS below, links to buy are in the components file.
My Pyduino library is very basic and great to modify add and takeaway form your final product however I ask for some credits like I have left for people in the arduino code.
Thx.
